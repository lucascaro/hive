# Hive Keyboard Shortcuts

## Sidebar Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Move cursor up / down |
| `J` | Jump to next project |
| `K` | Jump to previous project |
| `1`–`9` | Jump to Nth project (configurable via `jump_to_project`; the Nth key in the list jumps to the Nth project, so custom bindings like `F1,F2,…` also work) |
| `Space` | Toggle collapse/expand project or team |
| `←` / `h` | Collapse current project or team; if on a session, collapse its parent |
| `→` / `l` | Expand current project or team |
| `Shift+↑` | Move selected item (session, team, or project) up |
| `Shift+↓` | Move selected item (session, team, or project) down |

> **Vim-style aliases:** `↑`/`↓` are the default navigation keys. If your config sets `"nav_up": "k"` / `"nav_down": "j"` (the default before v0.8), those keys still work — arrow keys are always active as permanent aliases. `h` and `l` are built-in aliases for collapse (`←`) and expand (`→`) respectively.

## Session Management

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New project |
| `t` | New session (opens agent picker) |
| `T` | New agent team (opens wizard) |
| `Enter` | Attach to selected session |
| `r` | Rename selected session or team |
| `x` | Kill selected session (with confirmation) |
| `D` | Kill entire team (with confirmation) |
| `c` / `C` | Cycle project color forward / backward |
| `v` / `V` | Cycle session color forward / backward |

## Pane Focus

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Switch to sidebar view (focus sidebar; exits grid if open) |

## Grid View

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `g` | Open grid view for the current project |
| `G` | Open grid view for all projects |
| `←` / `→` / `↑` / `↓` / `h` / `j` / `k` / `l` | Navigate grid cells |
| `Enter` | Attach to selected session |
| `t` | New session in the selected session's project |
| `W` | New worktree session in the selected session's project |
| `x` | Kill selected session (with confirmation) |
| `r` | Rename selected session |
| `c` / `C` | Cycle project color forward / backward |
| `v` / `V` | Cycle session color forward / backward |
| `s` | Focus sidebar (closes grid and returns to sidebar view) |
| `g` | Switch to project-scoped view (while all-grid is open) |
| `G` | Switch to all-projects view (while project grid is open) |
| `Shift+←` / `Shift+↑` | Move selected session left (earlier) in its group |
| `Shift+→` / `Shift+↓` | Move selected session right (later) in its group |
| `Ctrl+P` | Open command palette (search and run any action) |
| `?` | Open help overlay |
| `S` | Open settings |
| `H` | Open tmux shortcuts reference |
| `q` | Quit app |
| `Esc` | Exit grid view |
| `i` | Enter input mode on focused cell (forward keystrokes to that session) |
| `1`–`9` | Quick-reply: send digit to the focused session (no attach needed) |

### Quick Reply

Press `1`–`9` directly in grid navigation mode to send that digit to the focused session. This is ideal for answering numbered prompts (e.g. "1. Accept  2. Always  3. No") without attaching or entering input mode. Works in all session states.

> **Opt-out:** Set `disable_quick_reply: true` in `~/.config/hive/config.json` to disable this feature.

### Grid Input Mode

When input mode is active, all keystrokes — including `Esc`, arrow keys, `Enter`, and `Ctrl+` combinations — are forwarded directly to the focused session. This lets you send quick confirmations (`y`/`n`), interrupt a running command (`Ctrl+C`), or nudge an agent without leaving the grid overview.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Exit input mode and return to grid navigation |
| `Esc` | Forward `Esc` byte (`\033`) to the session |
| `↑` / `↓` / `←` / `→` | Forward ANSI arrow sequences to the session |
| `Enter` | Forward carriage return (`\r`) to the session |
| `Ctrl+C` | Forward interrupt (`\x03`) to the session |
| Any printable key | Forward that character to the session |

> **Visual indicator:** A `INPUT · C-Q` badge appears in the focused cell's header while input mode is active.

> **Opt-out:** Set `disable_grid_input: true` in `~/.config/hive/config.json` to disable this feature entirely (the `i` key becomes a no-op in grid view).

## Status Indicator

Hive shows session state with a colored dot in the sidebar, team rows, and grid tiles:

- `○` gray: idle
- `●` green: working
- `◉` amber: waiting
- `✕` red: dead

The legend is visible in the main status bar and in the grid footer.

## Search & Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Start filter mode (type to filter sessions) |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette (fuzzy session search) |
| `Esc` | Cancel current input / close filter |

## Application

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `H` | Toggle tmux keybinding reference |
| `q` | Quit (tmux sessions persist) |
| `Q` | Quit and kill all managed sessions |
| `Ctrl+C` | Force quit |

## Mouse

| Interaction | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Left-click sidebar session | Select session (updates preview) |
| Left-click sidebar project or team | Toggle collapse / expand |
| Left-click preview pane | Focus preview and activate the displayed session |
| Left-click grid cell | Move grid cursor to that cell |
| Scroll wheel in sidebar | Move cursor up / down |
| Scroll wheel in preview | Scroll preview content up / down |
| Scroll wheel in grid | Move grid cursor up / down |

## Confirmation Dialogs

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` / `Enter` | Confirm |
| `n` / `Esc` | Cancel |

## Detach from an attached session

When you attach to a session (`Enter`), Hive's TUI suspends and you interact with the agent directly. To return to Hive, press the **detach key**:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Detach and return to Hive (default; configurable) |
| `Ctrl+B D` | tmux's standard detach sequence — still works as a fallback when using the tmux backend |

The detach key is set via the top-level `detach_key` field in `~/.config/hive/config.json` (not the `keybindings` block — see note below):

```json
{
  "detach_key": "ctrl+q"
}
```

**Accepted syntax:** `ctrl+<lowercase-letter>` only (e.g. `ctrl+q`, `ctrl+d`, `ctrl+x`). Alt-modifier and function keys are not supported. An invalid value falls back to `ctrl+q` with a warning printed to stderr at startup.

**Why a top-level field, not under `keybindings`?** The detach key is enforced by the multiplexer backend (the tmux backend installs a `bind-key -n` on the server before each attach; the native PTY backend intercepts the matching control byte on stdin). The `keybindings` block is processed by the in-TUI Bubble Tea key handler and never sees keystrokes during attach.

**Lifetime of the tmux binding.** On the tmux backend, Hive installs the binding via `bind-key -n` and intentionally leaves it in place across attach/detach cycles — the binding persists for the lifetime of the tmux server (or until you change `detach_key` and restart, or someone overwrites it). This is faster (no per-detach restore round-trip) and avoids a class of trap-restore fragility, at the cost of clobbering any user-defined `bind -n <key> ...` you may have in `~/.tmux.conf`. If you have such a binding you want to keep, set `detach_key` to a different `ctrl+<letter>`.

> ⚠️ **`ctrl+q` collides with terminal flow control (XOFF) on systems that have `ixon` enabled.** Most modern terminals disable it by default; if yours doesn't, set `detach_key` to a different `ctrl+<letter>` combination.

## Customization

All key bindings can be overridden in `~/.config/hive/config.json` under the `keybindings` key:

```json
{
  "keybindings": {
    "new_project": "n",
    "new_session": "t",
    "new_team": "T",
    "kill_session": "x",
    "kill_team": "D",
    "rename": "r",
    "attach": "enter",
    "nav_up": "up",
    "nav_down": "down",
    "nav_project_up": "K",
    "nav_project_down": "J",
    "filter": "/",
    "sidebar_view": "s",
    "grid_overview": "g",
    "palette": "ctrl+p",
    "help": "?",
    "tmux_help": "H",
    "quit": "q",
    "quit_kill": "Q",
    "move_up": "shift+up",
    "move_down": "shift+down",
    "move_left": "shift+left",
    "move_right": "shift+right"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Users who prefer vim-style navigation (`j`/`k` for up/down) can set `"nav_up": "k"` and `"nav_down": "j"` in their config. Arrow keys (`↑`/`↓`) are permanently available as aliases regardless of the configured key, so switching to vim-style config does not break arrow key navigation.

> **Reset to defaults:** Open Settings (`S`) and press `R` to reset all keybindings to their defaults. The change takes effect after you save (`s` → confirm).
